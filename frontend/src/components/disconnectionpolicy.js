                  Communication problems over the internet may cause sudden disconnection to the gameplay.

                  As we cannot guarantee uninterrupted connection due to factors such as poor reception or

                    Players must accept the risk of disconnection and should attempt to log back in and continue

                    the risk of disconnection.
